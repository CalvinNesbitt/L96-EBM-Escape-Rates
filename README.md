# L96-EBM-Escape-Rates

In this repository we study an interior crisis within a minimal model of climate, the L96-EBM. The L96-EBM was first introduced in Gelbrecht et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00175-0) whilst one can read more about interior crises here: http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Crises.

The contents of the project is as follows:

- Plotting-Escape-Rates, notebooks plotting escape rates and show key fits for the critical exponent.
- Relaxing-from-Bounded-Regions, simulations of the L96-EBM for different values of the solar parameter S.
- Transient-Lifetime-Classes, classes used in the computations of escape rates/critical exponents.
- L96-EBM-Path-Object-Classes, classes used to study relaxations in the L96-EBM.
